LUIS includes a set of prebuilt intents from a number of prebuilt domains
for quickly adding common intents and utterances to conversational client
apps. These include Camera, Music, HomeAutomation, and many more. We will
begin with a demonstration of Home Automation. Do note that typically you
will need to train the LUIS model with your speceific intents.

Below we will demonstrate a series of commands and identify the intent and
the entities, together with a confidence score.
